# rustalpha
A implementation in rust lang to generate all 3 character permutations with a alphabet

## Running

To deploy this project run

```bash
  rustc main.rs
  ./main
```

### Functionality
there are variables named:

per_characters 

per_length

Change these to have different outputs:

`per_characters` is used for the character list for the permutation.

`per_length` is used to see what is the lenght of the string output.

output is `output.txt`
